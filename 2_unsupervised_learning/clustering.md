# Clustering

The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

## K-Means
Searchs for K clusters in the data based on centroids distance.

1. The cendroids are randomly defined
2. Assign the closests points to each centroid
3. Changes the centroids location to minimize the points distance
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until the centroids locations do not change

```python

```
